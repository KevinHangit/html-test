  In 1939, Suffolk landowner Edith Pretty hires local self-taught archaeologist-excavator Basil Brown 
  They ignore Brown, who left school aged only 12, when he suggests the mounds could be Anglo-Saxon rather than the more common Viking era.
  Working with assistants from her estate, Brown slowly excavates the more promising of the mounds. One day the 
  trench collapses on him, but they dig him out in time. Meanwhile, he spends more time with Edith, a widow, and her
   young son, Robert, and ignores daily letters from his wife, May. Edith struggles with her health, warned by her doctor to avoid stress.
  Brown is astonished to uncover iron rivets from a ship, making it the burial site of someone of tremendous 
  distinction, such as a king. Prominent local archaeologist James Reid Moir attempts to join the dig but is rebuffed; 
  Edith instead hires her cousin Rory Lomax to join the project. News of the discovery soon spreads, and Cambridge archaeologist 
  Charles Phillips arrives, declares the site to be of national importance, and takes over the dig by order of the Office&nbsp;of&nbsp;Works.
